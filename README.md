# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

Welcome to the code repository for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model implementation. This repository contains the necessary code and documentation to get started with RAG, a powerful model that combines the benefits of dense retrieval and language generation.

## Overview

The RAG model leverages a retriever-generator framework to enhance the quality of generated text. By retrieving relevant documents and using them as context, the RAG model can produce more informative and contextually relevant outputs.
