# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

Welcome to the code repository for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model implementation. This repository contains the necessary code and documentation to get started with RAG, a powerful model that combines the benefits of dense retrieval and language generation.

## Overview

The RAG model leverages a retriever-generator framework to enhance the quality of generated text. By retrieving relevant documents and using them as context, the RAG model can produce more informative and contextually relevant outputs.

## Getting Started

To begin using the RAG model, please follow the link below to access the interactive Colab notebook:

**RAG Colab Notebook**

This notebook will guide you through the process of setting up the environment, loading the data, and running the model.

## Features

- Detailed implementation of the RAG model.
- Interactive Colab notebook for easy experimentation.
- Step-by-step instructions for model training and evaluation.
